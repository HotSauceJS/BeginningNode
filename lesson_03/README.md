# Lesson 03 - MongoDB

MongoDB is a database that stores documents in collections.

## Outline

There are two sections in this module.  First, learning the basics of
mongo through the shell.  And, second learning how to connect with Node.js

I. Mongo Shell
  1. [Shell Basics] (Shell_Basics)
  2. Mongo Commands :: ./Mongo_Commands
  3. Importing Data :: ./Import_Data

II. Mongo & Node
  1. Node Webserver v Express :: ./Mongo_Node

## Running Mongo

MongoDB will need to be installed to run the examples.  See resource
below for information.

MongoDB is almost always used as a network server.  To emulate this on
your computer, you will need to have a mongo server running locally.

Run the server:

    $ mongod

Connect with shell:

    $ mongo
